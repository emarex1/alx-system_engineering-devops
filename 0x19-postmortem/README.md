0x19-postmortem

As part of my software engineering studies with ALX Africa, I recently undertook a debugging assignment to investigate and resolve an issue with a WordPress website. In this postmortem, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the incident, including the timeline, root cause analysis, actions taken, and preventive measures implemented.

Issue Summary:
Duration of Outage: May 10, 2023, 08:00 AM — May 11, 2023, 04:00 PM (GMT+1)
Impact: The WordPress website experienced a critical error, resulting in significant downtime and limited functionality. The issue affected the entire user base, rendering the website inaccessible and returning 500 internal server errors.
Timeline:
Issue Detection:

Actions Taken:

Utilized monitoring tools like Datadog to gain insights into server performance and error logs.
Discovered that the error logs provided limited information and were not helpful in identifying the root cause.
Leveraged the tmux command line tool to run multiple sessions and efficiently trace the error.
Utilized the strace command to trace system calls and identify potential issues with file inclusions.
Assumed a potential typographical error within the WordPress configuration files.
Escalated the incident to myself as the responsible individual.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially suspected a server misconfiguration or compatibility issue with recent updates.
Explored database connectivity and plugin conflicts as potential causes.
Escalation:

The incident was solely managed and resolved by myself.

Incident Resolution:

May 11, 2023, 04:00 PM (GMT+1): Discovered a typographical error in the require_once directive within the /var/www/html/wp-settings.php file.
Corrected the typographical error by updating the require_once directive with the correct file name (class-wp-locale.php).
Verified the fix by monitoring error logs and confirming the elimination of 500 errors.
Successfully restored the website’s functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was identified as a typographical error in the require_once directive within the WordPress configuration file. Specifically, the incorrect file name ( class-wp-locale.phpp) prevented the inclusion of a required file, leading to the errors. To resolve the issue, I promptly corrected the typo, ensuring the correct file name was referenced in the directive.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents and enhance the website’s resilience, the following measures have been implemented:

Improve Configuration Management:

Establish stricter review processes for configuration changes to catch potential typographical errors and syntax issues.
Implement version control for configuration files to track changes and ensure easy rollback.
Strengthen Monitoring Capabilities:

Incorporate advanced monitoring tools, like Datadog, to proactively detect and investigate issues, enabling faster response times.
Set up alerts and thresholds to promptly notify of critical errors or anomalies.
Enhance Testing Procedures:

Implement comprehensive testing strategies to cover all aspects of the WordPress website, including configuration changes and plugin updates.
Establish a staging environment to thoroughly test changes before deployment.
